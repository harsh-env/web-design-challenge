# Unit 11 Homework: Web Visualization Dashboard 

## Background

Data is more powerful when we share it with others! Let's use what we've learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard featuring the analysis that we've done, as captured in the following image:

## Landing Page (Index.html) 

1. Landing page has links in Navbar for the 4 plots (viz - Max Temps, Humidity, Cloudiness and windspeed). 
2. The Data link on the right opens up the Dataframe used for the analysis. 
3. The graphs are interactive and can fit smaller screens (achieved by Bootstrap)
4. The Summary page also has "comparison" tab for visaluizing data on a single page
5. The link "Latitude" on left top corner takes the user back to Summary page. 

Below are snippets of the vis for each link
